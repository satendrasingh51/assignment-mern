# MERN Task Management Application

This project is a task management application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to manage their tasks with features such as creating, updating, deleting, prioritizing, and categorizing tasks.

## About Development key area.

Firt Clone code form repo. > install all dependency in both of side. > run frontend in fronted dir with npm start command and backend in root directory with npm run dev in development mode and npm start in production mode.
Frontend in Fronted folder.
Backend in root directory of project.
Backend running on port 5000
Backend :- http://localhost:5000
Frontend :- http://localhost:3000

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### Backend Development (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB)

- **CRUD Operations**: Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for tasks.
- **Task Prioritization and Categorization**: Develops an algorithm to prioritize tasks. Users can assign priority levels to tasks and assign categories to each task.

### Frontend Development (React.js, TailwindCSS(optional))

- **Dynamic User Interface**: Creates a user-friendly interface using React. The UI reflects real-time changes and provides a seamless user experience.
- **Task Interactions**: Allows users to add, view, edit, delete, categorize, and prioritize tasks.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Implements features to filter and sort tasks based on different criteria such as priority and category.

## Bonus

- **Deployed URL**: A deployed URL of the application is provided as a bonus.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mern-task-management.git

   \`\`\`

3. Install backend dependencies:

   \`\`\`bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   \`\`\`

4. Set up MongoDB:

   - Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on your system.
   - Create a \`.env\` file in the \`backend\` directory and add the MongoDB connection URI:

     \`\`\`
     MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_uri
     \`\`\`

5. Run the backend server:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm start
   \`\`\`

6. Install frontend dependencies:

   \`\`\`bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   \`\`\`

7. Start the frontend development server:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm start
   \`\`\`

8. Open your web browser and navigate to \`http://localhost:3000\` to access the application.
